# :notes: Turnit: an Automatic Page Turner for Musicians :notes:

Do you play a musical instrument? Are you tired of scrambling to flip pages or carrying around a foot pedal? Turnit will solve your problem! Our app allows you to upload multiple sheet music images and, whenever you're ready, listens to you play and displays sheet music image to you one by one, timed to flip at the right time.

We initially built this app as the final project for CPSC459/559 "Building Interactive Machines", where we combined computer vision algorithms (mainly template matching) with audio processing techniques to create an integrated system. We won the [Class Choice Award](https://cpsc459-bim.gitlab.io/f19/projects_list/) :trophy:, given to the top project in class. For a demo, check out this [video](https://youtu.be/lQWgagWgHMw) :clapper:. For more technical details, check out our accompanying [paper](https://cpsc459-bim.gitlab.io/f19/assets/reports/music.pdf) :page_with_curl:.

We're currently developing the second version for the app to handle more complex music by applying deep learning techniques.
